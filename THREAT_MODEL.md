# THREAT_MODEL.md

Documented security decisions live here so a reviewer does not have to rediscover the reasoning from
diffs. This file is a seed: the software factory's threat-model station owns growing it into the
full model; entries below are decisions that were made and reviewed on specific beads, not an
exhaustive analysis.

## CSP report endpoint (`/api/reports/csp`) — origin policy

- **Decision** (audio-feed-cspreports; review delta ruled by coord, 2026-10-29): reports arriving
  with an UNTRUSTED or ABSENT `Origin` header are accepted with **204** — so the browser flushes and
  does not retry — but are **never stored** and **never consume** the visitor's per-window write
  budget (`reports:budget:*`), and are not attributed to the visitor.
  - Trusted means the origin host is in the configured allowlist or a loopback host
    (`src/origin.ts`, `isTrustedReportOrigin`); `Origin: null` and a missing header are untrusted.
  - The drop is logged (event `csp_report.origin_untrusted_dropped`, carrying the origin value or
    the literal `(absent)`), so "no CSP violations today" cannot silently mean "every report was
    discarded by the origin policy".
- **Residual (documented, accepted):** legacy WebKit engines that POST CSP reports without an
  `Origin` header are indistinguishable from the untrusted case and are dropped the same way — their
  violations are invisible by policy. Accepting them would require trusting origin-less requests on
  a cross-origin reporting endpoint, which is the surface this policy exists to close.
